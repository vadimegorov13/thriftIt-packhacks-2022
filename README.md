## Sidenote

- Versions of every package do not change! They will not update by themself.
  - Reason: I found the perfect versions for every package for them to be compatible.
- There are potential problems if you use `yarn` instead of `npm`. In case there will be error delete `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, and use `npm` instead.
